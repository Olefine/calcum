# calcum
Simple math calculator with repl in the feature

This project aims to teach me how to write code in C and implements simple calculator.

###Example
Run it:
```
  ./calcum -n -d "10 + 5 + 3"
```
Result will output:
```
  result = 18
```

###Information
#####NOTE
Now we can set some flags(-n -d for example), but it will not affect the result of the calculation or display and need for feature.

#####TODO
- Dynamicly allocate space for nodes in tree
- Improve calculation perfomance
- Realize repl
- Add multiple and division operations
- Add simple math functions(log, cos, sin and e.t.c)

P.S This projects have no license, because it was created only for teach me C programming.

P.P.S If you want also learn C programming language and/or you interesting about creating and building 
arithmetic expressions welcome to contribute.
